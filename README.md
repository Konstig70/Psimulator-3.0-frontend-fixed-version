# Psimulator-3.0-frontend-fixed-version

This is a **fixed build of [rkuebert/psimulator](https://github.com/rkuebert/psimulator)**.  
The program itself is **not my work** — I only fixed a bug that caused the frontend to crash due to a (`java.lang.InterruptedException`) when capturing packets while pinging.

---

## What’s Fixed
- Crash during packet capture is resolved.
- Runnable `.jar` provided for convenience.

---

## Requirements
- Java 8 (tested with):

openjdk version "1.8.0_452"
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (Tencent Kona 8.0.22)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (Tencent Kona 8.0.22)
